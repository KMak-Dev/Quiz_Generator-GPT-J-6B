Read any novel published in the early part of the twentieth century and you will find female uneducated characters who spend their spare moments dreaming of movie stars, tennis-players, explorers...

{"prompt":"Even if the benefits are many, self-driving vehicles have a lot ofhoops to leap through. First, the technology is still very pricey. By one estimate, the first wave of autonomous vehicles could cost over 35 $100,000-five times the cost of the average new vehicle. Even that might be an underestimate: the 3-D sensors alone on Google's autonomous car cost about $70,000.\n\nThose costs would presumably come down over time, but no one knows how rapidly. And that's a big hurdle. One survey found that only 20 percent of Americans would \"definitely'' or \"probably'' buy a car with self-driving capabilities even if the price dropped to $30,000.\n \nWhat's more, while the technology is rapidly improving, it's far from perfect. Google's self-driving cars have now traveled more than 435,000 miles in California, but the cars have yet to be fully tested in urban environments.\n  \nMost likely, self-driving technology will emerge gradually, piece by piece. But even intermediate features pose unique challenges.\n\nEarly autonomous cars will likely require their human drivers to take the wheel during especially complicated situations. But as one car maker is discovering, it's difficult to get people to drift in and out of attention while driving - and the process of switching back and forth between robot and human could well make these cars less safe, at first.\n  \nThe Eno report also notes that there's still a ton of research yet to be done about the prospect of 50 self-driving cars. \"As long as crucial questions go unanswered,\" the report concludes, \"the nation will be hampered in its ability to successfully plan for and introduce [autonomous vehicles] into the transportation system.\"\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: Identify four main concerns which are holding back the introduction of self-driving cars.\nAnswer: cost is high, demand is low, technology has yet to be tested in urban environments, safety is still the biggest concern<|endoftext|>"}

Right now, they are full of rubbish but I think people would not throw rubbish into them if we filled them with soil and some bright plants. Also by adding plants, the front area would become more pleasant and fresh. Those corning home from a long day would see the plants and feel better.

{"prompt":"Why parents should start teaching their kids about money at an early age\n\nHow did you learn about money when you were a kid? Maybe your parents handed you a few dollars to buy some milk in the grocery store. You got through the checkout line, put the change in your pocket, and headed back home.\n\nToday, teaching kids how to manage money is different: Transactions are often no longer tangible and cash is becoming less common. This emergence of financial technology has increased convenience, but for families, it sometimes comes at a great cost.\n\nFrom cash to V-bucks and in-app purchases\nFortnite, Angry Birds, Candy Crush, My Little Pony — these popular games are all geared toward kids. Each offers in-app purchases that brings financial transactions straight into the hands of children. Kids playing these games can rack up thousands of dollars worth of in-app purchases without being fully aware of their actions. A simple Google search of “games for kids with in-app purchases” doesn’t bring up a list of games; it brings up how-to guides for parents to learn how to control or turn off the in-app purchasing capabilities, warning parents of how easy it can be for their child to accrue some serious debt on the platforms.\n\nThe issue has gotten so out of control that law enforcement officials have conducted investigations into major app servicers like Apple and Google. In 2017, Amazon was ordered to refund $70 million worth of app purchases made by kids, as reported by The Atlantic. A federal judge ruled Amazon guilty of not warning customers of in-app charges after the initial download, and failing to provide adequate measures in games for kids to prevent the purchases.\n\nNow that money is literally falling into the hands of children, determining who, how or when they should start learning how to manage it brings about a vague and indefinite debate.\n\nTeaching the basics of money\nResearch by the University of Cambridge reveals children as young as seven years old have an understanding of basic concepts related to finance. Talking about money isn’t always easy, though. The concept of sharing financial information has long been a taboo in the U.S. For families struggling, money management can often be a stressful topic, making parents want to protect their children from the realities of financial distress.\n\nRecently, though, there has been an upswing in financial conversations. Salary transparency is becoming more common in the workforce. Personal finance publishers are continuously popping up to educate and empower consumers. Apps geared toward kids are being developed to teach them money basics through simple tasks or games.\n\nImproving financial literacy in schools\nThe teaching of money basics in schools isn’t currently a nationwide effort, something a growing number of recent graduates wishes would have been the case. Only 16.4 percent of U.S. high school students are required to take a personal finance course. A January 2019 survey finds that 75.7 percent of the 1,000 millennials surveyed think personal finance courses should be mandatory in high school. Additionally, 84 percent of respondents agreed that high school didn’t prepare them to handle their money.\n\nSome states have been considering whether to implement required personal finance curriculum in schools. A bill in Maine backed by State Senator Matthew Pouliot would have the curriculum developed by the Department of Education, and be taught as early as kindergarten and through high school.\n\n“They have to make loan payments on a car,” Sen. Matthew Pouliot said, as reported by ABC 13 News. “They have to get student loans. They have to pay their grocery bill. There are a lot of things that we need to know about money for, and frankly, it’s not being taught in all schools equally.”\n\nMatt Matheson, an assistant principal in Alberta, Canada, says teaching kids the basics of money in school is a great idea. However, teaching money basics in school comes with limitations. Matheson says kids learn best by experience. “You can teach a child the difference between a need and a want, but they won’t be able to correctly discern between the two without practice in the real world, like at the grocery store.”\n\n“Teaching financial literacy in school can only go so far — what can’t be taught in a classroom should be supplemented at home by parents.”\n\n“It’s like we’re kind of missing the forest for the trees,” Matheson says. “Which is why boiling it down to the concept-based ideas is important, but ultimately the responsibility lies with parents 100 percent.”\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: According to the text, who is the MOST responsible for teaching children financial management?\nAnswer: Parents<|endoftext|>"}

Snatching up a handful of dry grass, he smashed at the loathsomeness of the flies that were feeding on it, as if the abomination was in them.

Parents refrain from broaching the subject with their children to protect them; people pay extra for cellphone numbers without the digit 4, which sounds like the Mandarin word for death; and few people register as organ donors or write their own wills for fear of cursing themselves.

{"prompt":"The researchers argue that certain factors make us more likely to have hindsight bias. Research shows that we remember information that confirms what we know as true. Also. we try to create a narrative that makes sense to us. When this narrative is easy to make, we will think the outcome must have been foreseeable. Furthermore, research suggests that we have a need for closure that lets us see the world as orderly and predictable and have a positive view of ourselves. Ultimately, hindsight bias matters because it gets in the way of learning from our experiences.\"lf you feel like you knew it all along, it means you won't stop to examine whv something really happened,\" observes Roese. \"lt's often hard to convince experienced decision makers that they might fall prey to hindsight bias.\"\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: According to this paragraph, state a negative effect of hindsight bias. \nAnswer: makes people overconfident<|endoftext|>"}

I thought this is odd because being afgunstig is so negative that as a Dutch person I could not imagine people freely admitting to feel it. But the word benijden, carrying a more positive connotation (although still signalling a negative experience), also conjures up in my mind. This observation brought the idea that there might be two subtypes of envy. This was certainly not a novel idea, it turned out, as Aristotle (along with other more recent scholars) already made such a distinction. However, ideas on subtypes differed and had not been empirically tested. Many scholars thought that only the destructive type of envy was ‘envy proper’; a more emulative form of envy was thought to be more akin to admiration.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: According to this paragraph, what is currently unknown about envy?\nAnswer: ideas on subtypes<|endoftext|>"}

Coming out first in the term tests attracted accusations of being teacher's pet. It was true, alas: Mr Slavin, although a fair-minded man, couldn't help smiling upon anyone who knew how to answer the questions. Too many boys in the class had trouble remembering their own names. Most of the heat was focused on an unfortunate called Thommo, who was caned regularly. For ordinary offences Thommo was caned by Mr Slavin and for more serious transgressions he was caned by the Deputy Headmaster. Mr Slavin was authorized to impart up to four strokes of the cane. Thommo usually required six even to slow him down. We used to sit silent while the Deputy Head gave Thommo the treatment outside in the corridor. The six strokes took some time to deliver, because Thommo had to be recaptured after each stroke, and to be recaptured he had first to be found. His screams and sobs usually gave away his location, but not always. One day the police came to the classroom and made Thommo open his Globite school case.

{"prompt":"The bees, in the meantime, go purposefully berserk. Zinging, small, aggressive atoms, gold in the late afternoon sun, attack again and again from different angles, trying to find a way into the bee-suit. Their persistence is unrelenting. Bees in the wild can burrow into the fur of an attacking bear, to sting the animal where it will hurt them hopping mad. In the same way, they seek the vulnerable chink in the beekeeper's second skin. A hole in the  finger-tip of a glove, a stray stitch on the seam, will not go unpunished. You feel like a character within a video game, surrounded by flying attackers. The bee-suit is slightly claustrophobic, limiting your vision but not the sounds, nor the sudden sight of bees flying onto the net visor, inches from your eyes. Willie says the bees can get to people mentally. 'They get you on  the shake,' he says. 'They undermine your confidence and go dab, dab, dab.' When a bee stings, a banana-like odour spreads in the air, attracting others to sting the same spot, like sharks drawn to blood pulsing through water.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: Find ONE metaphor for 'bees' the writer uses in this paragraph.\nAnswer: Aggressive atoms<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt":"In my film and philosophy class, for example, I have to insist that students put their devices away while watching movies that don’t immediately engage their senses with explosions, sex or gag lines. At first they see this as some old guy’s failure to grasp their skill at multitasking, but eventually most relearn how to give themselves to an emotional and intellectual experience, one that is deeply engaging partly because it does not pander to their most superficial habits of attention.

The smoke can help lull the bees. They think there is an emergency, eat their fill of honey as if ready for flight and become less aggressive, perhaps because less able to bend and sting. Willie takes the top off the first hive. Pffffff, pffffff, pffffff, goes the smoke. After a short pause, he heaves off the top box. Immediately, its weight reveals the exact extent of the haul. Honey is half as heavy again as water and a full box tells on your muscles. Beekeeping, in some aspects, is like fishing: some years you get next-to-nothing, in others you crop gold. This year everything worked, both skill and luck came together, and it is boom time; the weather was good over the year. Willie and his family have kept bees here for over fifty years, and he is now reaping the rewards of knowing his turf and keeping bees that are well adapted to their environment. This trip to Hangwell Law comes after a run of collecting a bumper harvest of heather honeycomb in ten days. It does not happen  every year, or even often. Some years he gets nothing at all.

They constantly check their phones and pay little attention to their environment, let alone what’s in front of them... their lack of seriousness is fantastic. You may think taking them to a restaurant would be a waste of time and money, but it’s not. You just have to find the right eatery.\n\nTo prove this theory, I took some friends and their two teenage daughters to the Food Garage. The family had recently relocated to New Zealand from America, and I thought if I could fill them with burgers, fries and hot dogs, they may feel less homesick. It worked like a treat.\n\nI first learned of the Food Garage after watching an episode of the TV show, Cool Food. At that time, it was just a humble food truck, turning out fast food that promised not to send you to a fast grave. After the show aired, fans flocked to the truck, and the business has since also opened a restaurant on 90 Wellesley St. West, in the City Works district.\n\nThe first things we ordered were fish wraps and mini pizzas. The wraps had plenty of zing and slap from fresh lime, and were topped with hot chilli and fresh greens all locally grown. The pizzas bore no resemblance to those served at late-night deliveries. This version consisted of a thin crust and a light layer of cheese. The flavours were moreish in the extreme. Next to arrive were our burgers and hot dogs. The knock-out was the hot dog, a dark sausage of minced and pickled pork, with homemade sauce.

I thought this is odd because being afgunstig is so negative that as a Dutch person I could not imagine people freely admitting to feel it. But the word benijden, carrying a more positive connotation (although still signalling a negative experience), also conjures up in my mind. This observation brought the idea that there might be two subtypes of envy. This was certainly not a novel idea, it turned out, as Aristotle (along with other more recent scholars) already made such a distinction.

{"prompt":"Obviously, walking around on two legs is not rocket science for me. The question is, why would I want to? Perhaps if I were in the circus, or hired to amuse the Great Unwashed, I’d consider leaping through a few proverbial hoops, but as of now, my responsibilities do not include ‘public spectacle.’ Frankly, I’d rather don one of those stupid sweaters and take my chances at the park, than prance around the streets of San Francisco like Little Lord Fauntleroy1.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: What does ‘Little Lord Fauntleroy’ imply about the writer’s feeling when he is at the park?\nAnswer: he feels proud of himself<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt":"Appearances aside, there’re some practical considerations that make the prospect of a ‘Bipedal Freddy’ completely untenable. Where for instance, do I put my front feet? When I’m upright, they are not only useless, they dangle and swing in a way that a casual observer might call ridiculous.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: What does ‘this altitude’ mean?\nAnswer: the height reached by standing upright<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt":"Secondly, the smells wafting through the air at this altitude are not nearly as varied or nuanced as those at ground level. My job requires me to ‘monitor every odor and lick every substance encountered on the floor, sidewalk, beach, street, etc.’ I take this responsibility seriously. True, the view from up here is superior, but there’s nothing special about my eyesight. My mammalian olfactory apparatus, on the other hand, is a miracle of evolution, and perfectly designed for the task at hand.

{"prompt":"Finally, there’s the matter of my penis. While not a defining attribute, my natural posture affords it a measure of built in circumspection. Up here though, the entire package, (or what’s left of it,) becomes a bit too... in your face?

{"prompt":"Despite decades of initiatives, it's still typically more expensive for local governments to recycle household waste than to send it to a landfill. Most recycled materials are exported, and the prices for these materials have plummeted because of lower oil prices and reduced demand for them overseas. The slump has forced some recycling companies to shut plants and cancel plans for new technologies.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: According to this paragraph, what is in less demand overseas? \nAnswer: Recyclable materials<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt":"The environmental benefits of recycling come chiefly from reducing the need to manufacture new products — less mining, drilling and logging.

{"prompt":"Gemmy’s visitors had appeared on a Thursday. In the days that followed one or two little things began to go wrong around the place. None of them was unusual, but that they should happen just now, and that there should be a string of them, was unsettling. Accidents, Jock told himself. Coincidence. He was trying hard to hold on to the normality of things, to resist in himself the wave of panic and suspicion that was running uncontrolled through the settlement. He did not believe the bit of trouble he was having was the work of blacks, and it had not yet occurred to him that it might be a neighbour. He and Lachlan fixed the break in the fence, while not involving Gemmy, and he kept to himself one or two later breaches in the daily run of things.

Who could have done the thing? He looked into one man’s face, then another’s, and could not tell, or what was worse, save himself from the poison now of suspecting each one of them.

At the conference, she talked about a woman whose husband, a soldier, came back from the war and they struggled to reconnect. The wife tucked love letters throughout the house as a way to say: \"Come back to me.

{"prompt":"Ever since I can remember I had dreamt of being famous. I know how embarrassing an admission this is. From the first moment I was aware of such a class of person existing, I had wanted to be a celebrity. We are forever telling ourselves that we live in a celebrity-obsessed culture; many hands are daily wrung at the supremacy of appearance over achievement. To desire fame argues a shallow and delusional outlook. This much we all know. But if we clever ones can see so clearly that fame is a snare and a delusion, we can also see just as clearly that as each year passes a greater and greater proportion of the western world's youth is becoming entramelled in that snare and dazzled by that delusion.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: Which 'class of person' does the writer refer to?\nAnswer: celebrity<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt":"You may wonder how our culture can be so broken and so sick as to venerate a pack of talentless nobodies who offer no moral, spiritual or intellectual sustenance and no discernible gifts beyond unthreatening photogeneity. My counter-argument to this would be, firstly, the phenomenon simply is not as new as everyone thinks it is. Read any novel published in the early part of the twentieth century and you will find female uneducated characters who spend their spare moments dreaming of movie stars, tennis-players, explorers... The propensity to worship idols is not new. We humans are naturally disposed to worship gods and heroes. I would rather see that impulse directed into the adoration of daft singers than into the veneration of militant politicians.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: What is 'the phenomenon'?\nAnswer: venerating to a pack of nobodies<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt":"Thirdly, look at the kind of people who most object to the childishness and cheapness of celebrity culture. Does one really want to side with such apoplectic bores? I should know, I often catch myself being one, and it isn't pretty. I will defend the absolute value of Mozart' over Miley Cyrus'', of course I will, but we should be wary of false dichotomies. You do not have to choose between one or the other. You can have both. The human cultural jungle should be as varied as the Amazonian rainforest. We are all richer for biodiversity. We may decide that a puma is worth more to us than a caterpillar, but surely we can agree that the habitat is all the better for being able to sustain each.

{"prompt":"Work was coming in thick and fast. But I was not famous. A few invitations to film premieres and first nights began to trickle in, but I found that I could walk the red carpet entirely unmolested. I remember going to some event with Rowan Atkinson5, the press night of a new play, I think. To hear his name shouted out by photographers and see the crowd of fans pressing up against the crash barriers caused the most intense excitement in me, combined with a sick flood of fury and resentment that no one, not one single person, recognized me or wanted my picture. Oh, Stephen. I have clicked on and selected that sentence, deleted it, restored it, deleted it and restored it again. A large part of me would rather not have you know that I am so futile, fatuous and feeble-minded, but an even larger part recognizes that this is our bargain. I cannot speak for others or presume to drag out their entrails for public inspection, but I can speak for (and against) myself. Maybe, to put a kinder construction to it, I was living proof that you could want to be famous and want to do the work, you could relish the red carpet and relish working into the early hours cranking out articles, scripts, sketches and scenarios with a genuine sense of pleasure and fulfilment.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: Who is the writer referring to when he says 'you'?\nAnswer: anyone<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt":"In from the cold among warm-hearted Koreans\n\nTen years ago, Oxford University graduate Daniel Tudor moved to Seoul, preferring the warmth of Korean society to \"cold\" Britain. The 31-year-old has since authored two books on his adopted home and has several other volumes in the pipeline. He speaks to Charmaine Chan about his latest title, A Geek in Korea, due out in June 2014.\n\nYou started, like so many other Westerners in Korea, teaching English. When did you begin writing about Korea and why? When I joined The Economist [2010-2013] I thought, \"Eventually I'd like to write a book about Korea because nobody else is really doing it.\"\n\nWhy weren't they? Korea is a bit off the radar for most people in Western countries. In the 1980s Japan was the big story and people pay attention to China now because of its huge population and market. Korea has fallen in between these two countries.\n\nIn your book, you write about jeong the invisible hug. Is that something exclusive to Korea? A lot of Koreans say Jeong - the warmth between people and mutual sacrifice is uniquely Korean, as 15 is han. It's nonsense, but Korea has words to describe these things, which shows they are important. Han is a burden, oppression or an injustice you can't correct. Its cause never goes away but you can temporarily forget about it by pursuing all-out, manic fun. This is where heung comes in. Heung is pure joy. The word isn't as famous as han, but I think that it should be. Even traditional Korean funerals used to feature extreme alcohol consumption, raucous singing, and the like.\n\nOften when Westerners think of East Asians, the stereotypes of stoicism and self-control - the socalled \"inscrutable oriental\" - come to mind. But Koreans in fact tend to be very expressive and open with their feelings. Somehow, sadness and happiness both seem to be magnified in Korea.\n\nHow is A Geek different from your first book? It's still about South Korea, but it's aimed at a younger audience. Consider it a gateway for those who like K-pop or TV shows from Korea, but don't know anything about the country.\n\nA few chapters are about K-pop. Are you into K-pop? Generally K-pop is for teenagers. I'm not saying it's wrong. It's a good business. But I like music played by people who mean what they're writing. Some people think all Korean music is K-pop, but there's really good music in Korea that's not superficial or played on the radio or on TV and doesn't go outside of Korea.

Korea's probably not the best country in which to be a woman. If you're a young woman in Korea, what's the best way to become wealthy or to achieve status? Sadly, it's to marry somebody.\n\nYou also write about how Koreans are obsessed with success and education. You find these mothers in Gangnam and they're scary. When I taught English I'd meet kids who, materially, led awesome lives and they'd show up in these big Mercedes with bags as big as they were. But if they didn't get an A grade in something, their parents would get mad and the next time you saw them they'd be crying. Wealthy families are obsessed with education. It's a status thing: preserve your status and show the rest of the world that you're preserving your status and your kids are doing well.\n\nWhy do you continue to live in Korea? This Jeong stuff - that's the thing that keeps me in Korea. Korea made me a better friend to my friends. England's a cold society and, growing up, I suppose I always wanted this feeling of being connected to people. I thought English people were a bit too cynical and cold. Korea is a place where you say, \"I like you. I love you.

It demonstrates that much of the good and bad fortune we encounter is a result of our thoughts and behaviour. More importantly, it represents the potential for change, and has produced an effective way of increasing the luck people experience in their daily lives. The research is not simply about debunking superstitious thinking and behaviour.

Willie takes the top off the first hive. Pffffff, pffffff, pffffff, goes the smoke. After a short pause, he heaves off the top box. Immediately, its weight reveals the exact extent of the haul. Honey is half as heavy again as water and a full box tells on your muscles. Beekeeping, in some aspects, is like fishing: some years you get next-to-nothing, in others you crop gold. This year everything worked, both skill and luck came together, and it is boom time; the weather was good over the year. Willie and his family have kept bees here for over fifty years, and he is now reaping the rewards of knowing his turf and keeping bees that are well adapted to their environment. This trip to Hangwell Law comes after a run of collecting a bumper harvest of heather honeycomb in ten days. It does not happen  every year, or even often. Some years he gets nothing at all.

{"prompt":"In primary school I ceased being the class half-wit and became class smart-alec instead. This presented a whole new set of difficulties. Coming out first in the term tests attracted accusations of being teacher's pet. It was true, alas: Mr Slavin, although a fair-minded man, couldn't help smiling upon anyone who knew how to answer the questions. Too many boys in the class had trouble remembering their own names. Most of the heat was focused on an unfortunate called Thommo, who was caned regularly. For ordinary offences Thommo was caned by Mr Slavin and for more serious transgressions he was caned by the Deputy Headmaster. Mr Slavin was authorized to impart up to four strokes of the cane. Thommo usually required six even to slow him down. We used to sit silent while the Deputy Head gave Thommo the treatment outside in the corridor. The six strokes took some time to deliver, because Thommo had to be recaptured after each stroke, and to be recaptured he had first to be found. His screams and sobs usually gave away his location, but not always. One day the police came to the classroom and made Thommo open his Globite school case. It was full of stolen treasures from Coles and Woolworths: balloons, bull-dog paper clips, funny hats, a cut-glass vase. Thommo was led howling away and never seen again.\nOutline:", "completion":"Question: What does 'the treatment' refer to?\nAnswer: caning"}

I was very keen not to be among those victimised. It followed that I should become one of those doing the victimising. Mears, the school's most impressive bully, had a favourite means of persuasion. Grasping your hand in one of his, he would twist your wrist with the other. After having this done to me by boys older and bigger, I sought revenge by doing it to boys younger and smaller.

Nola Huthnance was no mean talker herself, being joint holder, with her next-door neighbour Gail Thorpe, of the local record for yapping across the back fence - an unbeatable lunch-to-sunset epic during which there was no point at which one or the other was not talking and very few moments when both were not talking simultaneously. But not even Nola Huthnance could hold her own when my mother got going on the subject of her wonderful son and his outstanding intelligence. Long after I had been sent to bed, I would lurk in the hall listening to my mother extolling my virtues in the lounge room. Apparently Gogol's mother was under the impression that her son had invented the printing press and the steam engine. My own mother thought along roughly the same lines.

The national parks service of the USA illustrates how we can create havens for nature, where we maintain the flora and fauna at levels that would not have happened if nature were left to her own devices. In response to your point that human exploration would alter natural conditions on other planets, I propose a planetary park system that would bar the landing of spacecraft in protected areas to prevent destruction of the environment\n\nProf. Lee: You know that microorganisms can be spread across the planetary surface by dust storms, for example, so this approach would not protect non-park areas from human contamination.

He soon became fascinated by the diverse beetle world, which includes up to 350,000 species.
