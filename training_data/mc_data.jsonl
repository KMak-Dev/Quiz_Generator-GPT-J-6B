There are lots of different things that I'm discussing in the book, but I suppose what they have in common is they are arguing for the virtues of the stuff that doesn't fit into the standard categories; the stuff that we can't quantify; the stuff that we can't organize or put into a neat box; the stuff that we can't script. These things tend to make us feel anxious. We feel that we should have a script; that we should have a number; we should have a target; we should have a tidy desk.

Coming out first in the term tests attracted accusations of being teacher's pet. It was true, alas: Mr Slavin, although a fair-minded man, couldn't help smiling upon anyone who knew how to answer the questions. Too many boys in the class had trouble remembering their own names. Most of the heat was focused on an unfortunate called Thommo, who was caned regularly. For ordinary offences Thommo was caned by Mr Slavin and for more serious transgressions he was caned by the Deputy Headmaster. Mr Slavin was authorized to impart up to four strokes of the cane. Thommo usually required six even to slow him down. We used to sit silent while the Deputy Head gave Thommo the treatment outside in the corridor. The six strokes took some time to deliver, because Thommo had to be recaptured after each stroke, and to be recaptured he had first to be found. His screams and sobs usually gave away his location, but not always. One day the police came to the classroom and made Thommo open his Globite school case.

{"prompt":"Hong Kong now and then\n\nA decade has elapsed since the handover of Hong Kong, when it was returned to Chinese rule after 156 years of British administration. Mainland China has agreed to protect the interests of Hong Kong people, under the principle of 'one country, two systems', for another 40 years.\n\nParadoxically it seems that change may be inevitable, if our city is to maintain its vibrant image. If you have observed any differences over the past ten years, or would like to share your views with us about Hong Kong's future, please send your comments and personal stories to our website.\n\nA.\nWe spent 6 years in HK: 3 years before the handover, and 3 years after. It is surprising just how little HK has altered. We continue to visit HK often, and the only important change we have seen is the great influx of tourists from the Mainland. HK remains a fabulously vibrant place, which continues to develop at the leading edge of Asia and world commerce. It remains the safest major city I have ever visited!\nH. S.

In my opinion the British did a marvellous job with HK. It's now up to China to preserve this jewel, and allow the people of Hong Kong to continue its growth. My hope for HK is that it will not be ruined by conflicting political ideals, but rather it will continue to prosper and be an example to China of what the rest of the country could be.\nJ.E. (Canada)\n\nC.\nA couple of years ago I travelled to Hong Kong and spoke to a lot of locals about life in post-handover Hong Kong. The consensus was that they were not happy; wages had fallen and property prices had also fallen. People were particularly concerned about the loss of Cantonese culture with the flood of mainland Chinese coming to the island both as visitors and to take up work. Many Hong Kong people no longer considered themselves as Chinese, but as Hong Kongers.\nA.P. (New Zealand)\n\nD.\nI grew up in Hong Kong and now study in England. I was only 9 when Hong Kong was handed over to the Chinese government, but I can certainly say that things have changed positively in general. Sure enough, there are a lot of things and issues that we want resolved, but I cannot deny that the HKSAR government has been working hand in hand with the general public to make Hong Kong a better place to live in. I love Hong Kong. I am proud to be Chinese, and I am also proud to be from Hong Kong.\nC. Y. H. (England)\n\nE.\nAs a visitor, I was in HK in the 70's, the 90's, and in 2006. It is always an exciting city, a shopping paradise, with super food and nice people. I have not really noticed any change, except for increased traffic, the new airport and new malls. Unfortunately I do not speak Cantonese, so my impression is only superficial. If I were younger (I am 65) and starting a business career, I would relocate there and learn the language.\nR.L. (Gibraltar)\n\nF.\nThe Hong Kong that tourists enjoy is vanishing. The Tai Yuen Street Markets in Wanchai are a testimony to this. These charming little streets that sell a colourful array of Chinese curios, cheap clothes, fruit and vegetables and have congee restaurants will soon be no more, making way for more buildings and more cash for developers (as if HK and they don't have enough!).

{"prompt":"Initially, the food truck business model looked attractive. As Mexicue co-founder Thomas Kelly told Forbes sitting in the top floor of their store on Seventh Avenue, the truck was cheaper, offered lower risk than opening a restaurant and allowed him and partner David Schillace to test out their concept without having to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars. While they sunk their life savings into the truck, putting it together cost less than $100,000.\n\nAs early adopters, the Mexicue crew saw explosive growth. Their first day, parked in midtown Manhattan surrounded by the skyscrapers that investment banks call their home, the Mexicue truck attracted lines around the block.

Competition in New York City is ferocious, and the food truck business is no different. Mexicue found itself struggling to find good parking spots, a major factor in food truck success, as other trucks would leave as early as 3:3o in the morning to secure a solid location.

{"prompt":"Food trucks: There is nothing wrong with the individual food truck per se, but the overall trend is both ridiculous and in some cases, morally reprehensible. The food media continues to treat these as a new form of cuisine and some sort of breakthrough invention when they are nothing more than a way to deliver food to consumers, akin to the \"invention\" of home delivery, takeout containers or the drive through. When grouped together in parking lots, food trucks become an outdoor version of a longstanding American culinary tradition - the shopping mall food court., and nothing more. Foodwise, there is nothing new about trucks which serve foods you can already get in countless traditional eateries, albeit with much more limited menus.

The real trend is the redundant food truck - like one serving pizza parked across the sidewalk from a rent paying pizzeria. When I visit New York, I see trucks parked curbside in neighborhoods overflowing with good and diverse restaurants and having no need at all of food trucks. This strikes me as absurd.

{"prompt":"Ever since I can remember I had dreamt of being famous. I know how embarrassing an admission this is. From the first moment I was aware of such a class of person existing, I had wanted to be a celebrity. We are forever telling ourselves that we live in a celebrity-obsessed culture; many hands are daily wrung at the supremacy of appearance over achievement. To desire fame argues a shallow and delusional outlook. This much we all know.

If the social-networking services of the digital age teach us anything it is that only a fool would underestimate the intelligence, intuition and cognitive skills of the 'masses'. I am talking about more than the 'wisdom of crowds' here. If you look beyond sillinesses like the puzzling inability of the majority to distinguish between your and you're, you will see that it is possible to be a fan of reality TV, talent shows and bubblegum pop and still have a brain.

{"prompt":"Work was coming in thick and fast. But I was not famous. A few invitations to film premieres and first nights began to trickle in, but I found that I could walk the red carpet entirely unmolested. I remember going to some event with Rowan Atkinson5, the press night of a new play, I think. To hear his name shouted out by photographers and see the crowd of fans pressing up against the crash barriers caused the most intense excitement in me, combined with a sick flood of fury and resentment that no one, not one single person, recognized me or wanted my picture. Oh, Stephen. I have clicked on and selected that sentence, deleted it, restored it, deleted it and restored it again. A large part of me would rather not have you know that I am so futile, fatuous and feeble-minded, but an even larger part recognizes that this is our bargain. I cannot speak for others or presume to drag out their entrails for public inspection, but I can speak for (and against) myself. Maybe, to put a kinder construction to it, I was living proof that you could want to be famous and want to do the work, you could relish the red carpet and relish working into the early hours cranking out articles, scripts, sketches and scenarios with a genuine sense of pleasure and fulfilment.\nOutline:", "completion":"Which sentence is the writer referring to when he says 'that sentence'?\nA.
